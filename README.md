# Planetary System Simulation

This is a simulation program that allows users to create and explore a virtual planetary system. Users can add planets that orbit around a central sun and even add moons that orbit around these planets. Additionally, the simulation provides the flexibility to modify various parameters associated with the orbits.

## Features

- **Add Planets:** Users can add multiple planets to the simulation, each with its own orbit around the central sun.
- **Add Moons:** Moons can be added to individual planets, creating a more intricate system of celestial bodies.
- **Orbit Parameter Modification:** The simulation allows users to modify various parameters related to the orbits of planets and moons. These parameters include the distance from the central body, orbital period, eccentricity, and inclination.
- **Add Camera in orbit** Users can add a camera in orbit to a moon or a planet.

## Getting Started
